This project shows how i used flask to make an API using SQLAlchemy, this API can be accesed locally when the entire code is run and all packages in the requirements.txt file are installed. The API documentation is located <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2568017/TVRhd9qR#0d46f5c0-0b41-4bf4-af71-70e0c6a7f475">here</a>.
The API uses a database in which the data is stored and can be accessed and modified via HTTP GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE requests. This project was made to demonstrate my understanding of flask and SQLAlchemy to make applications.
