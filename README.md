<h1 align="center">Cafe API</h1>
<p>This project was made to showcase my skills with creating RESTful API's, this API allows for users to send get, post, patch and delete requests to the API in order to add, read, update and delete data from the database.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
This project shows how i used flask to make an API using SQLAlchemy and SQLite, this API can be accesed locally when the entire code is run and all packages in the requirements.txt file are installed.
Developed a Cafe API that enables users to manage a cafe database, including adding cafes with details like location, name, image, Wi-Fi availability, and power sockets. Users can retrieve random cafes, search by location, update entries, and delete cafes. The API documentation is located <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2568017/TVRhd9qR#0d46f5c0-0b41-4bf4-af71-70e0c6a7f475">here</a>
